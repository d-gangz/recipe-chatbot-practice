ok now look at all the scripts inside @homeworks/hw3/scripts. then look at @homeworks/hw3/hw3_walkthrough.ipynb for the reference in terms of how the flow would be like. Then I would like to get ur help to create a comprehensive guideline doc that can help guide a junior developer for him to understand how to implement an LLM as a judge, like the process to do it. include relevant code snippets if required. E.g the shape of the data required to be passed into the `judgy` package.

create this guide as a doc called llm-judge-guide.md inside the @homeworks/hw3/learnings folder.
