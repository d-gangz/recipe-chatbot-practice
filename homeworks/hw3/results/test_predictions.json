The instructions mention blending the cooked soup or gently warming it on low heat without boiling to maintain a 'raw' feel, but the initial cooking process (saut\u00e9ing and simmering) clearly violates the 'raw vegan' restriction, which requires that ingredients are not heated above approximately 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C).
