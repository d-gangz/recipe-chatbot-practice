# Recipe Chatbot Practice

Practice project for an AI evaluation course featuring five progressive homework assignments that teach practical techniques for assessing and improving AI systems.

## Project Layout
- `backend/` – reusable chatbot utilities and helpers
- `homeworks/` – course exercises and notebooks organized by assignment
- `scripts/` – runnable tools such as bulk testing helpers
- `data/` – sample inputs used during experimentation
- `results/` – exported evaluation artifacts from script runs

## Getting Started
1. Create or activate the local environment: `uv venv`
2. Install dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run tools through the environment, for example: `uv run python scripts/bulk_test.py`

## Coursework Flow
Follow each homework in order, using the provided scripts to collect responses, store results under `results/`, and iterate on evaluation techniques as you progress through the five assignments.
